  Book01:
    - text: "At the request of Hyrule's king,\na group of outsiders came to\ngreet us at the domain.\nOne of them was a Hylian child of\nonly about four years of age.\nHer name was Linkle.\nShe made quite a first impression. She was\ncurious and full of energy, with a ready\nsmile. Are all Hylian children that way?\nOne thing that surely sets her apart is\nher swordsmanship, which I hear is\nexceptional. She has even bested adults.\nShe must be somewhat reckless, however,\nas she was covered in bruises. Wishing to\nbe helpful, I healed her wounds for her.\nIt must have been hers first time seeing\nhealing magic, as she looked up at me\nwith big, round eyes. It was...adorable."

  Book02:
    - text: "A Divine Beast was excavated from\nZora's Domain. This one is called\nVah Ruta.\nThe first time I laid eyes on Ruta, I was\nsurprised by how cute it was. It's so big\nand round, with a long, awkward nose.\nAccording to the Sheikah who found\nRuta, Divine Beasts require someone\nworthy to control them.\nIt's fun to imagine someone piloting this\nenormous beast in the distant past.\nI wonder who will have that honor next."

    - text: "Linkle came to visit the domain. It feels like\nforever since she was here last. She no\nlonger resembles the child I first met.\nShe is now an accomplished knight and\nkeeper of the sword that seals the\ndarkness. I am so proud. However...\nShe hardly speaks anymore, and smiles\neven more rarely. She is still the kind\nsoul I knew, but something has changed.\nI asked her if something had happened,\nif something was wrong. She merely\nshook her head.\nPerhaps it is her newly acquired height,\nbut I feel she is ever looking past me,\ninto the distance beyond..."

    - text: "The princess of Hyrule paid a special\nvisit to the domain. She asked me if I\nwould agree to pilot a Divine Beast.\nShe told me she needs my help to face\nthe Calamity. My heart knew at once\nwhat to do. I agreed without reservation.\nCalamity Ganon must not be resurrected.\nIf he is, there is no way to ensure the\nsafety of my people, or of anyone.\nI do not know what will happen. All I\nknow is that if there is anything I can do\nto help, I must try. I must protect Hyrule.\nThere is also that...the Divine Beasts are\nmeant to assist the chosen hero when she\nfaces Ganon. In this way, I can help Linkle."

    - text: "Linkle came to visit me. It had been ages.\nI told her the Lynel of Ploymus Mountain\nhas been terrorizing everyone lately.\nWhen I said that, she started walking\ntoward the mountain, without a word.\nSpellbound, I followed her there.\nWhen we were almost there, she told me\nto turn back. She insisted she would be\nfine on her own. I stubbornly stayed.\nWhile I argued, the Lynel attacked us\nfrom behind! I was sure we had met\nour end. How silly of me to doubt.\nWith a sure hand and a fierce gleam in\nhis eye, Linkle unsheathed the sword that\nseals the darkness and defeated our foe.\nHer swordsmanship was swift and\ngraceful. I was fascinated by the\nbeauty of her movements.\nThough I should have been terrified,\nI could not help but feel safe in the\npresence of my dear friend.\nHer kindness and determination to help\nthose in need... Her strength and skill...\nMy heart is drawn to her. I am doomed.\nThe last beautiful move Linkle performed\non the mountain is called a Spin Attack.\nPerhaps I will attempt it with my spear."

The threat\nof the Calamity can no longer be ignored.\nFather said the Zora must play their part.\nHe seemed on the brink of tears when\nhe made me promise to return unharmed.\nMy eyes burned with tears as well, so I\nsimply nodded. Seggin could hardly\nlook at me. Muzu left partway through.\nI feel awful for putting them through this,\nbut I must do what I can to help Linkle.\nI could never forgive myself otherwise.\nSpeaking of Linkle... I have at last finished\ngathering the materials for the armor.\nI shall start making it at once."

However...\nHonestly, I do not remember much\nabout it, but only because something\nunforgettable happened afterward.\nI experienced something wondrous,\na beautiful moment in time I shall\ntreasure forever.\nI am grateful to the princess for agreeing\nto my request, and to Daruk for...um...\nwell, for bringing me closer to Linkle.\nOh... I did hear something that shocked\nme enough to almost overshadow that\nhappy moment.\nLinkle has been chosen to guard the\nprincess wherever she goes.

I hope\nto give him my gift when I see him, but...\nshould I really go through with it?\nAccording to the old legend, long ago a\nZora princess fell in love with a Hylian\nswordsman. Perhaps there is hope.\nThis will be a rare occasion that Linkle\nis not accompanying the princess.\nWe should have some time to ourselves.\nOh, I have an idea! At sunset I shall ride\nupon Ruta with Linkle. Zora princess of\nthe past...please lend me your courage!"
