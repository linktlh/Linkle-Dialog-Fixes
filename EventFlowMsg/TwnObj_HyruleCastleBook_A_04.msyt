We are calling it the\nSheikah Slate.\nWe have not found any mention of a\nname for this object in the records\nwe have unearthed so far...\nNevertheless, Purah insisted we call it\nthe Sheikah Slate, as the relic is a slate\nmade by the Sheikah tribe.\nFeels a bit on the nose to me, but it was\nnot a fight I thought I could win."

Records mention a greater\nnumber of themâ€”and even other types.\nThey are said to be stored in five giant\ncolumns that rest beneath Hyrule\nCastle. The thing is...\nNo matter how I search beneath the\ncastle, I can't seem to locate these\ncolumns. They must be buried deep.\nWere they perhaps designed to sense\nthe appearance of Calamity Ganon\nand to only activate upon his return?"

Is the Sheikah Slate\nthe key to activating them?\nThat is Purah's theory, and I concur.\nAnd yet, my experiments so far have\nbeen fruitless.\nStill, we must exhaustively investigate all\nmeans of opposing the Calamity. We must\nnot give up, no matter what!"

Sheikah\ntext is featured prominently on it.\nIt is made of an unknown material,\nbut we believe it is the same as the\nshrines scattered across each region.\nImpa proposed that I hold on to it for\nnow. I hope that it leads to some new\ndevelopments in our research."
