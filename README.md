# I noticed an error in the dialog!
Please take a screenshot and then go to issues, and submit an issue using the format included.<br>

# I'd like to help fix issues
Great! :D Anyone is welcome to edit and make a pull request.<br>
Please make sure to note everything changed. Otherwise, we may just deny the pull request.<br>

# How to properly do a pull request:
First, find all the files you changed, and make a pull request with the following information.<br>
What you changed and why you changed it.<br>

EX: 
Pull request with the file ActorType/ArmorHead.msyt edited.<br>
I changed the word hero to heroine in ActorType/ArmorHead.msyt/Armor_039_Head_Desc<br>
(Note that hero vs. heroine is an issue with many perspectives and usage can depend on context.)<br>

# I'd like to help, but how do I edit these msyt files?
Simply edit the .msyt files in your preferred text editor.<br>
Please don't delete or change any controls/data you don't recognize as they are information the game needs to display special formatting.<br>
