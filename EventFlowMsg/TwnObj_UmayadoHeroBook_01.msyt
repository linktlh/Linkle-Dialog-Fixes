She was\ncurious and full of energy, with a ready\nsmile. Are all Hylian children that way?\nOne thing that surely sets her apart is\nher swordsmanship, which I hear is\nexceptional. She has even bested adults.\nShe must be somewhat reckless, however,\nas she was covered in bruises. Wishing to\nbe helpful, I healed her wounds for her.\nIt must have been hers first time seeing\nhealing magic, as she looked up at me\nwith big, round eyes. It was...adorable."

It's so big\nand round, with a long, awkward nose.\nAccording to the Sheikah who found\nRuta, Divine Beasts require someone\nworthy to control them.\nIt's fun to imagine someone piloting this\nenormous beast in the distant past.\nI wonder who will have that honor next."

However...\nShe hardly speaks anymore, and smiles\neven more rarely. She is still the kind\nsoul I knew, but something has changed.\nI asked her if something had happened,\nif something was wrong. She merely\nshook her head.\nPerhaps it is her newly acquired height,\nbut I feel she is ever looking past me,\ninto the distance beyond..."

My heart knew at once\nwhat to do. I agreed without reservation.\nCalamity Ganon must not be resurrected.\nIf he is, there is no way to ensure the\nsafety of my people, or of anyone.\nI do not know what will happen. All I\nknow is that if there is anything I can do\nto help, I must try. I must protect Hyrule.\nThere is also that...the Divine Beasts are\nmeant to assist the chosen hero when she\nfaces Ganon. In this way, I can help Linkle."

It had been ages.\nI told her the Lynel of Ploymus Mountain\nhas been terrorizing everyone lately.\nWhen I said that, she started walking\ntoward the mountain, without a word.\nSpellbound, I followed her there.\nWhen we were almost there, she told me\nto turn back. She insisted she would be\nfine on her own. I stubbornly stayed.\nWhile I argued, the Lynel attacked us\nfrom behind! I was sure we had met\nour end. How silly of me to doubt.\nWith a sure hand and a fierce gleam in\nhis eye, Linkle unsheathed the sword that\nseals the darkness and defeated our foe.\nHer swordsmanship was swift and\ngraceful. I was fascinated by the\nbeauty of her movements.\nThough I should have been terrified,\nI could not help but feel safe in the\npresence of my dear friend.\nHer kindness and determination to help\nthose in need... Her strength and skill...\nMy heart is drawn to her. I am doomed.\nThe last beautiful move Linkle performed\non the mountain is called a Spin Attack.\nPerhaps I will attempt it with my spear."

Seggin could hardly\nlook at me. Muzu left partway through.\nI feel awful for putting them through this,\nbut I must do what I can to help Linkle.\nI could never forgive myself otherwise.\nSpeaking of Linkle... I have at last finished\ngathering the materials for the armor.\nI shall start making it at once."
