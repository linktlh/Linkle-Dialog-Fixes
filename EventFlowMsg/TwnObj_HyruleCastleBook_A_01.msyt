Not\neven during the royal funeral or later\nwhen she and I were alone with our grief.\nI must assume her strength is a result of\nus repeatedly informing her of her duty\nto be a valiant and steady princess.\nFor a child of merely six years of age,\nher conduct was truly that of a born\nleader. Her strength gives me hope.\nFrom now on, I must raise her all alone...\nNow, only I remain to prepare her for her\ndifficult future as princess of Hyrule."
