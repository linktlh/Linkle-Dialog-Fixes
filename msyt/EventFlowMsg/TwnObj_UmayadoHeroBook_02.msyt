    - text: "I'm gonna start writin' in this \"diary\"\nthing startin'...now. Ugh, a diary...\nMaybe I'll call it my training journal.\nThey say all ya gotta do is write down\nstuff that happens. Us Gorons prefer the\nsimple life, so I hope simple stuff counts.\nLet's see. For today's journal entry,\nwhat should I write about?\n\nOh, I know! I had some rock roast from\nthe peak of Death Mountain. It was\ndelicious! I think I'll eat more of it soon."

    - text: "I talked to some Hylians at the base of\nthe mountain. All anyone wants to talk\nabout these days is Calamity Ganon.\nReminds me of when those tiny Sheikah\ncame to Death Mountain a few years ago\nto dig up that Divine Beast or whatever.\nThe Hylians were sayin' that beast thing\nis a weapon someone will need to\nlearn how to control.\nBack in the good ol' days, Gorons didn't\nworry about relics we couldn't eat.\nMmm... Now I'm hungry.\nMaybe I'll track down a prime rock roast\nfor one of my dinners tonight!"

    - text: "Today I saw someone bein' attacked\nwhen I was out lookin' for lunch rocks\nat the peak.\nHe was a little tiny guy, so I rushed down\nthe mountain to help him. I was shocked\nto find he was handy with a sword!\nBy the time I rolled his way, he'd already\ntaken out all the monsters! I couldn't\nhelp but admire his Goron-like strength.\nWhile I was distracted, a monster almost\ngot the jump on me. He stopped it.\nThe Great Daruk...saved by a tiny Hylian.\nI must have had a dopey look on\nmy face when that happened.\nHope he didn't notice."

    - text: "That little Hylian from before is named\nLink. He's got a respectable appetite.\nLoves to eat meat, fruit, vegetables...\nall sorts of things a decent person\nwouldn't dream of eating.\n\nLink will cook up and eat just about\nanything. I offered him some Grade A\nrock roast to help refine his palette.\nI asked him how it tasted. He liked it\nso much, he was speechless.\n\nI knew Hylians could eat rocks too.\n\n\nEating isn't the only thing Link and I\nhave in common. The little guy is also\nincredibly strong!\nHe said sometimes when he focuses,\nit feels like time slows down. Heh!\nI really like that guy.\nHe's the type of guy you can trust to\nhave your back and also have a nice\nhearty meal with.\nYeah! That settles it! From now on,\nLink is an official brother."

When I said I would,\nthe princess seemed really happy.\nThere will be four Champions to control\nfour Divine Beasts, and one swordsman\nto take on Ganon.\nIncluding the princess, our anti-Ganon\nteam is six strong, made up of all\ndifferent kinds of people.\nThis has the makings of an epic feast.\nI got the ball rollin' by giving the\nprincess my best rock roast.\nShe said thanks, but...I think she was\nholdin' back a grimace. Must have had\nsomethin' foul on her mind."

    - text: "I'm a Champion now. Feels good.\n\n\nI hadn't talked with Link in a while,\nso seeing him at the inauguration\nceremony was nice. It was a good day.\nOh, word has it Link has been chosen as\nZelda's appointed knight. I can't think\nof a better brother for the job.\nI hear one of those ancient machine\nthings went nuts during some test\nand shot out deadly beams!\nWith true Goron spirit, Link grabbed a\npot lid from the ground and deflected\nthe blast.\nHe nailed the thing in its weak spot\nand saved the day.\n\nHis bravery caught the king's eye,\nand not long after that, he was\nappointed to guard Zelda!\nI'd expect nothin' less from the\nlittle guy!"

    - text: "I've been chosen to pilot Rudania, but I\nwas havin' trouble controlling it. I was\nthe only Champion who was struggling.\nI asked Link for advice, but he just\nshoved me into the Divine Beast so\nI could explore it aimlessly all day.\nI can't explain it, but by the end of\nthe day, I was able to control Rudania\njust how I wanted to!\nI guess experience is the best teacher.\nLittle guy's strength must come from\nworkin' hard and never givin' up.\nGood lesson, brother! As thanks,\nI'm gonna treat him to some gourmet\nsirloin rock."

    - text: "All my Hylian brother seems to do these\ndays is watch over the tiny princess\nwhile she does her research.\nIt looks like tough work, but the princess\nseems a lot happier and talks more since\nshe's been doin' it, so it must be OK.\nI hear the little guy finally opened up\nabout his troubles to the princess\nwhile they were shovelin' food.\nSurprisingly, she opened up right back.\nSaid somethin' princessy like, \"I guess\nwe're the same, you and I.\"\nHmm... Sounds heavy. They must\nhave been bondin' over their food\npreferences. That'll do it, all right.\nSpeakin' of openin' up, all this journal\nwritin' has made me realize somethin'\nabout myself...\nWriting makes me hungry."
