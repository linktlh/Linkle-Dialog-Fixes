    - text: "My dear friend from afar came to visit\nGerudo Town today. It is always a\npleasure to see the queen of Hyrule.\nShe described her reason for coming\nas urgent. She wished for me to meet\nher newborn child.\nHer sweet daughter's name is Zelda.\nShe has her mother's smile. I cannot\nhelp but cherish her already.\nI told her that Zelda is sure to grow up\ninto a dignified and beautiful queen,\njust like her mother.\nMy friend thanked me, but said that looks\nare fleeting, and instead she wishes for\nZelda to be blessed with true happiness.\nThe way she gazes upon her daughter...\nher little bird, as she calls her...I have\nnever seen such unconditional love."

    - text: "It has been a long while since we laid\nmy dear friend, the queen, to rest.\nI only now have the will to write again.\nIt was so sudden. I still can't believe\nshe is gone.\n\nAll of my sweet memories of her keep\nrunning through my mind. Even now,\nI can hardly keep the tears at bay.\nYoung Zelda kept her head held high\nas she said her final good-bye to her\nmother at the funeral.\nShe carried herself as a true princess,\nbut I can sense the deep grief she is\nhiding within. I worry for her..."

  Book03:
    - text: "I made a voyage to visit Hyrule.\nAfter speaking with the king, I saw\nZelda for the first time in a year.\nIn truth, it was my concern for her\nthat brought me there.\n\nThe king allowed me to keep her\ncompany as she went to the spring\nfor her training.\nThere, Zelda prayed and prayed in the\nspring's icy waters until the sun set.\n\nI told her many times to stop, but she\nwouldn't listen. I eventually had to\ndrag her out of the water.\nZelda gazed at me for the longest time\nwith heartbreaking vulnerability.\n\nEventually, in a tiny voice, she told me\nof the pressure and panic she feels at\nnot being able to fulfill her sacred duty.\nShe whispered over and over, \"Why can I\nnot do as the royal daughters of the past\nhave done? What is wrong with me?\" \nAll I could do was hold her close\nand listen... I pray that it is enough."

    - text: "Emissaries from Hyrule came to see me\ntoday. They informed me that I have been\nchosen to pilot the Divine Beast.\nMy people are uneasy about it. They tell\nme such a dangerous task is not fitting\nfor the chief. I understand their fear.\nHowever, I intend to accept this task.\n\n\nCalamity Ganon's resurrection does not\nonly threaten Hyrule, but the whole\nworld. I refuse to sit idly by.\nGanon is also closely associated\nwith the Gerudo...an association\nI deeply resent.\nI believe Zelda will be here soon to\nreceive my official answer. I am excited\nto see her, as always."
