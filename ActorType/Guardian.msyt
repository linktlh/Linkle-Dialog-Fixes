  Enemy_Guardian_B_PictureBook:
    - text: "The Sheikah of ancient Hyrule developed\nthis as a weapon to combat Ganon. This\nstationary model was used for defending\nimportant structures. Its offensive power\nis on par with other Guardians, and omitting\nthe legs kept the manufacturing costs low."
  Enemy_Guardian_A_PictureBook:
    - text: "The Sheikah of ancient Hyrule developed\nthis as a weapon to combat Ganon. Its six\nlegs give it extraordinary mobility compared\nto most current vehicles, and its powerful\nlaser provides far greater offensive capability\nthan conventional weaponry. Destroying the\nlegs severely reduces its mobility."
