    - text: "Though Robbie initially presumed that it was the\npower of love that set the ancient oven right\nagain, he soon realized the cause was actually\nme lighting the furnace with blue flame.\n\nIf I give it some ancient materials\nand a generous supply of rupees, the\nancient oven will provide some\nancient soldier gear in exchange."
