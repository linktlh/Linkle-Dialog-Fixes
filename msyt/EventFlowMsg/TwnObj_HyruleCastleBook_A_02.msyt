    - text: "I said something awful to him today...\n\n\nMy research was going nowhere. I was\nfeeling depressed, and I had told him\nrepeatedly not to accompany me.\nBut he did anyway, as he always does,\nand so I yelled at him without restraint.\n\nHe seemed confused by my anger. I feel\nterribly guilty...and that guilt only makes\nme more agitated than I was before."

    - text: "I am unsure how to put today's events\ninto words. Words so often evade me\nlately, and now more than ever.\nHe saved me. Without a thought for his\nown life, he protected me from the\nruthless blades of the Yiga Clan.\nThough I've been cold to him all this\ntime...taking my selfish and childish\nanger out on him at every turn...\nStill, he was there for me. I won't ever\nforget that. Tomorrow, I shall apologize\nfor all that has transpired between us.\nAnd then...I will try talking to him.\nTo Link. It's worth a shot."

    - text: "Bit by bit, I've gotten Link to open up\nto me. It turns out he's quite a glutton.\nHe can't resist a delicious meal!\nWhen I finally got around to asking why\nhe's so quiet all the time, I could tell it\nwas difficult for him to say. But he did.\nWith so much at stake, and so many eyes\nupon him, he feels it necessary to stay\nstrong and to silently bear any burden.\nA feeling I know all too well... For him,\nit has caused him to stop outwardly\nexpressing his thoughts and feelings.\nI always believed him to be simply a\ngifted person who had never faced a\nday of hardship. How wrong I was...\nEveryone has struggles that go unseen\nby the world... I was so absorbed with\nmy own problems, I failed to see his.\nI wish to talk with him more and to see\nwhat lies beneath those calm waters,\nto hear him speak freely and openly...\nAnd perhaps I, too, will be able to bare\nmy soul to him and share the demons\nthat have plagued me all these years."

    - text: "Father scolded me again today. He told\nme I am to have nothing more to do with\nresearching ancient technology.\nHe insisted that I focus instead on\ntraining that will help me awaken\nmy sealing magic.\nI was so frustrated and ashamed I could\nnot even speak. I've been training since\nI was a child, and yet...\nMother passed the year before my\ntraining was to begin. In losing her,\nI lost not just a mother, but a teacher.\nMother used to smile and tell me,\n\"Zelda, my love, all will be well in\nthe end. You can do anything.\"\nBut she was wrong. No matter how I try\nor how much time passes...the sealing\npower that is my birthright evades me.\nTomorrow I journey with Link to the\nSpring of Power to train. But this, too,\nwill end in failure. Such is my curse."

In a place\nconsumed by darkness, a lone woman\ngazed at me, haloed by blinding light.\nI sensed she was...not of this world.\nI don't know if she was a fairy or a\ngoddess, but she was beautiful.\nHer lips spoke urgently, but her voice\ndid not reach me. Would I have heard\nher if my power was awoken?\nOr was my dream simply a manifestation\nof my fears? I am sure I will know the\nanswer soon, whether I wish to or not..."

The other Champions\nwill accompany us there.\nI have not seen my father since he last\nscolded me. Things are too strained\nnow... I will meet with him when I return.\n...\n\n\nActually...I've had a horrible feeling ever\nsince that weird dream. No one would\nbelieve a failure of a princess, but...\nRight now,"

I must learn all I\ncan about the relics so we can stop him.\nIf the fortune-teller's prophecy is to be\nbelieved, there isn't much time left...\n\nAh, but turning over these thoughts in\nmy head puts me ill at ease. I suppose\nI should turn in for the night.\nP.S. Tomorrow my father is assigning\nHIM as my appointed knight..."

The feeling stayed with\nme so long, I grew anxious and weary.\nIt is the same feeling I've felt before in\nhis company... And still, not a word\npasses his lips.\nI never know what he's thinking! It makes\nmy imagination run wild, guessing at\nwhat he is thinking but will not say.\nWhat does the boy chosen by the sword\nthat seals the darkness think of me?\nWill I ever truly know?\nThen, I suppose it's simple. A daughter\nof Hyrule's royal family yet unable to\nuse sealing magic... He must despise me."
