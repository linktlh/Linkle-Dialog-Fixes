Now I'm hungry.\nMaybe I'll track down a prime rock roast\nfor one of my dinners tonight!"

She's got a respectable appetite.\nLoves to eat meat, fruit, vegetables...\nall sorts of things a decent person\nwouldn't dream of eating.\n\nLinkle will cook up and eat just about\nanything. I offered her some Grade A\nrock roast to help refine her palette.\nI asked her how it tasted. She liked it\nso much, she was speechless.\n\nI knew Hylians could eat rocks too.\n\n\nEating isn't the only thing Linkle and I\nhave in common. The little lady is also\nincredibly strong!\nShe said sometimes when she focuses,\nit feels like time slows down. Heh!\nI really like that girl.\nShe's the type of girl you can trust to\nhave your back and also have a nice\nhearty meal with.\nYeah! That settles it! From now on,\nLinkle is an official brother."

I can't think\nof a better brother for the job.\nI hear one of those ancient machine\nthings went nuts during some test\nand shot out deadly beams!\nWith true Goron spirit, Linkle grabbed a\npot lid from the ground and deflected\nthe blast.\nShe nailed the thing in its weak spot\nand saved the day.\n\nHer bravery caught the king's eye,\nand not long after that, she was\nappointed to guard Zelda!\nI'd expect nothin' less from the\nlittle lady!"

Sounds heavy. They must\nhave been bondin' over their food\npreferences.
