A double discovery!\nI bet there are all kinds of amazing\nroyal-family secrets hidden in those\nrooms just waiting to be revealed!\n\"Secrets of the Royal Family Uncovered!\"\nThat headline alone would keep food on\nthe table for months!\nBut there's no way I'm going anywhere\nnear a place as dangerous as Hyrule\nCastle. No way!\nDon't let that scare you, though...\nTraysi's Recommendation: ★★★★★"
