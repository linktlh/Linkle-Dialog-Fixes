    - text: "This enormous monster is naturally\ncamouflaged as a rock formation. Neither\nsword nor arrow can pierce its stony form,\nbut a cunning adventurer knows to scale\nits body and attack the ore sprouting from\nits peak. Unlike your average Stone Talus,\nthis type's ore deposit contains a large\namount of precious ore."

  Enemy_Giant_Senior_PictureBook:
    - text: "The largest monster to make its home in\nHyrule, the Hinox lives primarily in forested\nareas. A keen awareness of your surroundings\nis paramount when facing one, as Hinox are\nknown for tearing entire trees from the ground\nand using them as weapons. Black Hinox\nwear metal greaves that conduct electricity\nrather well. A deft hand can steal weapons\noff the necklaces they wear."
  Enemy_Giant_Bone_PictureBook:
    - text: "The mere remains of what was once a giant\nmonster known as a Hinox. These skeletal\nbeasts appear at nighttime. Much like their\nliving counterparts, the Stalnox will tear entire\ntrees from the ground to use as weapons.\nFurthermore, even if it appears defeated at\nfirst, it will keep coming back for more as long\nas its eye is left intact."
