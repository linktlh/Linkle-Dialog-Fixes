First,\nI would carry the blue flame from\nTumlea Heights.\nNext, I would melt the ancient materials,\nrefine the result, and then shape it into\nancient soldier gear.\nIt's difficult to say how much progress\nI made on my research. The routine\ndemanded so much focus, day after day.\nBut then I had a clever thought!\nI realized I could automate the entire\nrefinement process!\nIt took some significant work, but I was\nable to successfully remodel the\nGuidance Stone.\nThanks to my effort, it can refine any\nancient material inserted into it and offer\nsomething in return.\nI named this machine Cherry, after the\nfirst girl I ever loved..."
