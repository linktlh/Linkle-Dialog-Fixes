I cannot\nhelp but cherish her already.\nI told her that Zelda is sure to grow up\ninto a dignified and beautiful queen,\njust like her mother.\nMy friend thanked me, but said that looks\nare fleeting, and instead she wishes for\nZelda to be blessed with true happiness.\nThe way she gazes upon her daughter...\nher little bird, as she calls her...I have\nnever seen such unconditional love."

Even now,\nI can hardly keep the tears at bay.\nYoung Zelda kept her head held high\nas she said her final good-bye to her\nmother at the funeral.\nShe carried herself as a true princess,\nbut I can sense the deep grief she is\nhiding within.

I eventually had to\ndrag her out of the water.\nZelda gazed at me for the longest time\nwith heartbreaking vulnerability.\n\nEventually, in a tiny voice, she told me\nof the pressure and panic she feels at\nnot being able to fulfill her sacred duty.\nShe whispered over and over, \"Why can I\nnot do as the royal daughters of the past\nhave done? What is wrong with me?\" \nAll I could do was hold her close\nand listen... I pray that it is enough."

They tell\nme such a dangerous task is not fitting\nfor the chief. I understand their fear.\nHowever, I intend to accept this task.\n\n\nCalamity Ganon's resurrection does not\nonly threaten Hyrule, but the whole\nworld. I refuse to sit idly by.\nGanon is also closely associated\nwith the Gerudo...an association\nI deeply resent.\nI believe Zelda will be here soon to\nreceive my official answer. I am excited\nto see her, as always."
