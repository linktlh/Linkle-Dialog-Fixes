I...could get used to this.\nThe elder asked me what I would like as\na prize for my achievements. I told him\nI wish for an archery training ground.\nIf I am to keep this up, I need somewhere\nto train at varying elevations. I'm hoping\nto master a new move I've dreamed up..."

I thought of declining,\nbut then she looked me dead in the eye\nand held my gaze as she said...\n\"We must protect the precious life of\nthis land from the Calamity's grasp at\nall costs. Hyrule needs you, Revali.\"\nIt was so corny, I almost died.\nBut I won't soon forget the look in her\neyes. She meant it with all of her heart.\nI thought Hylians only thought of\nthemselves, but I suppose there's\nan exception to every rule.\nI'm going to accept, of course.\nBut out of self-respect, I'm going\nto let her sweat it out a bit longer."

I can never tell\nwhat's on his mind. Likely nothing at all.\nSomehow I can't help but believe the\nstories about him beating adult knights\nin swordplay when he was only a child.\nStill, he doesn't stand a chance against\nme. There is no one alive who can\nkeep up with my aerial combat.\nThat reminds me.

Nothing.\nNo reaction at all to my impressive feat.\nI showed it to him even knowing there\nwas a chance of failure, since it's still\nso new. He must truly be slow-witted.\nI tried to provoke him into facing me,\nbut to no avail. It's like talking to\na stone.\nOur interactions were a waste of time,\nso I flew off to find solace with Medoh.\n\nWhat's wrong with that guy?"
