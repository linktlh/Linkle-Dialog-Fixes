    - text: " Her death\nwas so sudden and unexpected, I awaken\nmost nights unsure if she is really gone.\nZelda never cried, never faltered. Not\neven during the royal funeral or later\nwhen she and I were alone with our grief.\nI must assume her strength is a result of\nus repeatedly informing her of her duty\nto be a valiant and steady princess.\nFor a child of merely six years of age,\nher conduct was truly that of a born\nleader. Her strength gives me hope.\nFrom now on, I must raise her all alone...\nNow, only I remain to prepare her for her\ndifficult future as princess of Hyrule."

To wait until she is ready.\nBut our situation is dire and leaves no\nroom for weakness—even on behalf of\nmy beloved daughter.\nMy heart breaks for Zelda, but I must act\nas a king, not a father. I must order her\nto train relentlessly at the fountain."

I'd love\nnothing more than to console her...\nBut I must stay strong. She MUST\nfulfill her duty, just as we all must.\nEven if she comes to despise me."

But understanding\nthe Divine Beasts alone will take time...\nZelda's eyes lit up like a wildfire when\nI told her about the relics... I must admit,\nshe has a knack for research."
