I was around that age\nwhen I was first able to continue my\nresearch following the Great Calamity.\nThe first thing I did was try to figure out\nhow to expand the functionality of the\nSheikah Sensor.\nI was around 80 years old when that\nexpansion was completed. I intend to\nbequeath this tech to our sleeping hero.\nI hope to the gods that he will be able to\nassist in the destruction of the Calamity\nthat swallowed our Princess Zelda whole."

Perhaps his power had been\nbuilding all that time.\nThe slaughter that followed was arbitrary\nand merciless. The destruction complete.\n\nWe lost everything... Hyrule Castle,\nPrincess Zelda... Well, perhaps not \neverything was lost.\nA youth named Link was brought to me a\nhundred years ago, covered in wounds\nand on death's doorstep.\nLink... So young, yet so courageous.\n\n\nHe was the youngest knight to have ever\nbeen appointed to the Imperial Guard at\nHyrule Castle.\nHe was also a gifted swordsman who was\nselected as captain of Princess Zelda's\npersonal guard.\nI thought his skills would be enough to\ndefeat Ganon in glorious fashion...\n\nSince ancient times, the royal family of\nHyrule and us Sheikah researchers have\nhad a strong bond. Their pain is our own.\nWe took the swordsman and the\nSheikah Slate Princess Zelda left\nbehind to the Shrine of Resurrection.\nAlthough the Slumber of Restoration had\nnot been fully tested, we decided to put\nthe swordsman under to save his life.\nIt was the best we could do..."
