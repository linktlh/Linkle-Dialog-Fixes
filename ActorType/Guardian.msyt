      - text: "The Sheikah of ancient Hyrule developed\nthis as a weapon to combat Ganon. Its six\nlegs give it extraordinary mobility compared\nto most current vehicles, and its powerful\nlaser provides far greater offensive capability\nthan conventional weaponry. Destroying the\nlegs severely reduces its mobility."
